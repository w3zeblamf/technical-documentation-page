          Cascading Stylesheets — or CSS — is the first technology you should
          start learning after HTML. While HTML is used to define the structure
          and semantics of your content, CSS is used to style it and lay it out.
          For example, you can use CSS to alter the font, color, size, and
          spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add
          animations and other decorative features.

          You should learn the basics of HTML before attempting any CSS. We
          recommend that you work through our Introduction to HTML module first.
          In that module, you will lear about:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li style="list-style-type: disc">HTML basics</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: disc">More advanced HTML modules</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: disc">
            CSS, starting with the introduction to CSS module
          </li>
          <li style="list-style-type: disc">CSS basics</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: disc">JavaScript Basics</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: disc">
            JavaScript, and how to use it to add dynamic functionality to the
            web page
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Once you understand the fundamentals of HTML, we recommend that you
          learn further HTML and CSS at the same time, moving back and forth
          between the two topics. This is because HTML is far more interesting
          and much more fun to learn when you apply CSS, and you can't really
          learn CSS without knowing HTML.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before starting this topic, you should also be familiar with using
          computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it,
          consuming the content). You should have a basic work environment set
          up as detailed in Installing basic software and understand how to
          create and manage files, as detailed in Dealing with files — both of
          which are parts of our Getting started with the web complete
          beginner's module.

      <section class="main-section" id="Modules">

        <p>
          This topic contains the following modules, in a suggested order for
          working through them. You should definitely start with the first one.
          <br /><br />

          <strong>CSS first steps</strong> <br /><br />
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages —
          for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your
          content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other
          decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your
          path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the
          syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to
          HTML.<br /><br />

          <strong>CSS building blocks</strong><br /><br />
          This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've
          gained familiarity with the language and its syntax, and got some
          basic experience with using it, its time to dive a bit deeper. This
          module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we
          have available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and borders,
          debugging, and lots more. The aim here is to provide you with a
          toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all the
          essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like
          text styling and CSS layout.<br /><br />

          <strong>Styling text</strong><br /><br />
          With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for
          you to concentrate on is styling text — one of the most common things
          you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals,
          including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing,
          drop shadows and other text features. We round off the module by
          looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and
          links.<br /><br />

          <strong>CSS layout</strong><br /><br />
          At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style
          text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits
          inside. Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in the right
          place in relation to the viewport, and one another. We have covered
          the necessary prerequisites so we can now dive deep into CSS layout,
          looking at different display settings, modern layout tools like
          flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning, and some of the legacy techniques
          you might still want to know about.

        <header>Solving common CSS problems</header>

        <p>
          Use CSS to solve common problems provides links to sections of content
          explaining how to use CSS to solve very common problems when creating
          a web page.
        </p>

        <p>
          From the beginning, you'll primarily apply colors to HTML elements and
          their backgrounds; change the size, shape, and position of elements;
          and add and define borders on elements. But there's not much you can't
          do once you have a solid understanding of even the basics of CSS. One
          of the best things about learning CSS is that once you know the
          fundamentals, usually you have a pretty good feel for what can and
          can't be done, even if you don't actually know how to do it yet!

        <header>What is CSS?</header>
        <p>
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web
          pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what
          CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms
          about the language.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="What_is_CSS_for?">
        <header>What is CSS for?</header>
        <p>
          As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how
          documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.
          <br /><br />

          A <strong>document</strong> is usually a text file structured using a
          markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you may
          also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.
          <br /><br />

          <strong>Presenting</strong> a document to a user means converting it
          into a form usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome,
          or Edge , are designed to present documents visually, for example, on
          a computer screen, projector or printer. <br /><br />

          CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example
          changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to
          create layout — for example turning a single column of text into a
          layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information.
          It can even be used for effects such as animation. Have a look at the
          links in this paragraph for specific examples.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4><strong>Note:</strong></h4>
          <p>
            You can find links to all the CSS property pages (along with other
            CSS features) listed on the MDN CSS reference. Alternatively, you
            should get used to searching for "mdn css-feature-name" in your
            favorite search engine whenever you need to find out more
            information about a CSS feature. For example, try searching for "mdn
            color" and "mdn font-size"!
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="CSS_syntax">
        <header>CSS syntax</header>
        <p>
          CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of
          styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of
          elements on your web page. For example "I want the main heading on my
          page to be shown as large red text."
        </p>

        <p>
          The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the
          styling described above:
        </p>

        <pre>
        <code>   
        <span class="selector">h1</span>   {  
               <span class="property">color</span>:  red;
               <span class="property">font-size</span>:  5em;
        }    
        </code>
    </pre>

        <p>
          The rule opens with a selector . This selects the HTML element that we
          are going to style. In this case we are styling level one headings
          (&lt; h1 &gt;).
        </p>

        <p>
          We then have a set of curly braces { }. Inside those will be one or
          more declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs.
          Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting,
          then a value that we'd like to give the property.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before the colon, we have the property, and after the colon, the
          value. CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on
          which property is being specified. In our example, we have the color
          property, which can take various color values. We also have the
          font-size property. This property can take various size units as a
          value.
        </p>

        <p>
          A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the
          other.
        </p>

        <pre>
        <code>   
        <span class="selector">h1</span>   {  
               <span class="property">color</span>:  red;
               <span class="property">font-size</span>:  5em;
        }    
        </code>
        
        <code>   
        <span class="selector">p</span>   {  
               <span class="property">color</span>:  black;
        }    
        </code>
    </pre>

        <p>
          You will find that you quickly learn some values, whereas others you
          will need to look up. The individual property pages on MDN give you a
          quick way to look up properties and their values when you forget, or
          want to know what else you can use as a value.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4><strong>Note:</strong></h4>
          <p>

        </code>
    </pre>

        <p>
          The syntax for each specified value depends on the data type defined

        <h3>Style rule examples</h3>

        <pre>

        <p>
          For a beginner-level introduction to the syntax of selectors, see our
          guide on CSS Selectors. Be aware that any syntax error in a rule
          definition invalidates the entire rule. Invalid rules are ignored by
          the browser. Note that CSS rule definitions are entirely (ASCII)
          text-based, whereas DOM-CSS / CSSOM (the rule management system) is
          object-based.
